#Observation: we can see that most of the time over the month the traffic volume was normal and that is the dominant condition
#high and low are less frequent and their frequency is merely the same
#the distribution is skewed toward normal

#Observation: we can see that the car counts are in every traffic situation and that's occupying most of the traffic no matter the traffic situation is,
#we can also see that bike and bus counts are almost the same in every situation and occupies the same percentage
#for the truck count, in heavy-high-low situations are almost the same proportion but increases largely in normal

#observations: The distribution is right-skewed, with a peak frequency between 30 and 80 total vehicles, indicating that this range is the most common total traffic volume.
#The frequency gradually decreases as the total vehicle count increases

#observations: the relationship is weak
#Data is spread across all visibility levels, with higher counts at higher visibility.

#all others are roughly equal but minor contribution in traffic.

#Observation: all days are similar in total vehicle counts except for friday
#vehicle counts are relatively consistent across days
#friday shows the highest median and upper whisker, indicating peak traffic
#outliers are minimal, suggesting stable daily patterns with occasional peaks.

#observations: Warmer temperatures are associated with higher traffic volumes, possibly due to increased activity.

#observations: we can see that there are 2 peaks of vehicle counts from 5-10 and 15-20
#we can assume that they are the hours of people going to work, school or college, etc and the hours of going back home.
#The bimodal pattern reflects morning and evening rush hours.

#observation: morning, afternoon and evening have the highest average vehicle counts, indicating peak traffic periods.
#while night and late night are lower, showing reduced traffic outside daytime hours.

        names = c('Car', 'Bike', 'Bus', 'Truck'),
        col = c("skyblue", "lightgreen", "lightpink", "lightgray"))

#observations: we can see that car count shows the highest median and IQR, with values ranging from 50 to 150, indicating a significant presence of cars over the month.
#the outlier in car count suggests rare instances of extremely high car traffic.
#bike, bus, and truck couns have much lower medians and IQRs, indicating these vehicle types are less frequent and more consistent in number.
#cars dominate the traffic volume
